Statistical analysis on what makes a post viral.

For my analysis data was collected referring to characteristics of the popular website of Mashable (www.mashable.com). A total number of 10000 observations from 61 different variables (58 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive and 1 goal field) will be used for this analysis purposes.

The R code was required (by the proffessor) to be in the Appendix of the final report.
